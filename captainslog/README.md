Comp20 Lab 6 - Captain's Log

Upon visiting the page, the user will correctly see all past log entries
which are rendered from local storage, with th most recent at the top along
with a readable string indicating when each log was submitted. The user can
add a new log that will immediately appear in the log entries list, at the 
top because it is the newest. The html was not changed and jquery was used
to implement the page. 

I did not collaborate with anoyone on this assignment. 

I spent approximately 2 hours on the assignment.
