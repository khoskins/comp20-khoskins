# Comp 20 Fall 2016 Projects
## Katherine Hoskins


###Purpose of Repository
This repository contains the code for projects completed during 
the Fall 2016 Web Programming course at Tufts University. 

###Reflections on the Course
My favorite assignment from the course was the MBTA page, which
used Google Maps to generate a map showing the nearest MBTA station
to the user at any give time, as well as a schedule of upcoming 
trains for that station. In my internship last summer, I first 
experienced web development, using javascript and API requests, and
this project really helped me to solidify my knowledge of these
subjects. Frequenty I would learn something during the project and 
be able to connect it back to real work I was doing as an intern, which
I found to be very rewarding. 

Over the course of the semester, I have grown into a programmer who is
comfortable with the concepts and skills behind basic web development, and
also am confident that if required to learn to use a new tecnology, I now
have the skills to teach it to myself and use it in a project. Before the
course I hsa some web development experience, but in sporadic areas, and
the course helped tie together all the knowledge I had gathered from
personal projects and internships. 

The most important thing that I learned in the course was how to learn. 
Specificially, how to take an idea or concept and figure out the 
techonology required to make that idea reality and how to actually
use that technology. In the Group Project for example, my job was to 
design and implement the HTML of the game, including the homepage, user hub
login page and login/out functionality. I had not done much page design
before but came across bootstrap and decided to use that to help create
a clean and user friendly page. Similarly, when my group decided we wanted
to have users be able to log in and out of the game, I had to research
options and finally decided to use the Google API instead of building
our own user database and authentication. These and other experiences 
taught me how to research options and weigh costs and benefits to determine
the best technology to use to achieve a particular goal.

Now that the course is over, I would like to delve deeper into page design
and build my own personal website. One of our assignments was to build a 
personal page, but currently it is static and has a very rudimentary design. 
I would like to take the design concepts I learned from the Group Project and
the skills I learned about javascript and other tools to revamp my site and
use it as a platform from which to display all that I have learned this 
semester. In addition, I would like to learn more about databases. My previous
internships, and job after graduation, are in data analytics but my knowledge
of databases is not very extensive. I would love to have a stronger grounding
in the subject before I graduate next May.
