comp20 Assignment 2: MBTA Red Line
October 31, 2016

Features:
	Upon visiting the web page, the user will see a map centered at their
	current location, which is marked with a person icon. Also shown on the
	map is the MBTA Red Line, which is represented with red lines drawn 
	between train station icons. If the user clicks on their current location
	icon, a window will pop up announcing their closest red line station, as
	well as the distance in feet to that station. A blue line also appears
	showing the distance from the user to that station. If the user clicks on
	any of the train station icons, another window opens showing the name of
	the station and a list of the trains coming through that station. The
	list is in sorted order and announces how much time there is before the
	train arrives in minutes and seconds.
