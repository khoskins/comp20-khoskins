comp20 Lab: Responsive Design
September 25, 2016

The corresponding html file and CSS stylesheet demonstrate the use of sprite

different part of a larger image depending on the width of the browser window,
as outlined in the assignment sheet. I did not collaborate with anyone on 
this assignment and spent 1.5 hours working on it.
