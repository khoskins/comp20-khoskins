comp20 Lab: Responsive Design

The corresponding html file and CSS stylesheet correctly demonstrate a use case
of sprite sheets. A different area of the image is shown on the screen depending
on the size of the browser window. The portion of the image to show depending
on the size is outlined in the assignment sheet and implemented correctly by
only changing the CSS. This lab took me 1.5 hours to complete and I did not
consult with anyone on it.
