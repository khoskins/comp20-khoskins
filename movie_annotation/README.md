Correct Implementation:
Upon loading the index.html file, a movie clip appears below a title. When the user
plays the video, subtitles will appear underneath the clip when each new audio is
stated. The time that each subtitle appears is not exact, but rounded to the 
nearest whole number in seconds.

Collaboration:
I collaborated with Claudia Mihm and Caroline Nowak. 

Time Spent:
